function neighbors = xffsrfparseneighbors(fid, numvtx)
% xffsrfparseneighbors  - parse neighbors from SRF file
%
% FORMAT:       neighbors = xffsrfparseneighbors(fid, numvtx)
%
% Input fields:
%
%       fid         input file fid (fopen)
%       numvtx      number of vertices
%
% Output fields
%
%       neighbors   Nx2 cell array with content
%        {N, 1}     1x1 double, number of neighbors for vertex(N)
%        {N, 2}     1xN double, list of neighbors
%
% See also xff
